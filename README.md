# Introduction of MTI Radar
MTI Radar (Moving Target Indicator Radar) is a type of radar system used to detect and track moving targets, such as vehicles, aircraft, or ships. Unlike other radar systems
that can detect both stationary and moving targets, MTI radar is specifically designed to filter out signals from stationary objects and focus only on signals from moving
targets. MTI radar works by transmitting a series of short radar pulses and then analysing the reflected signals.The radar system compares the frequency of the returned signal to the frequency of the original transmitted signal.If there is a difference in frequency, it means that the target is moving.The MTI radar system then tracks the moving target by continuously transmitting and receiving radar pulses and analysing the changes in frequency of the reflected signals.

# CLUTTER
Ground clutter refers to the unwanted signals that are detected by a radar system when it reflects off objects on or near the ground, such as buildings, trees, hills, and other structures.
These unwanted signals can interfere with the radar's ability to detect and track targets, especially at low altitudes and close range.

# Delay line canceller
To remove these unwanted components from the received signal, a delay line canceller uses a series of delay lines and subtractors. The received signal is split into two paths, one of which is delayed by a certain amount of time using a delay line. The delayed signal is then subtracted from the original signal using a subtractor, which cancels out any components that are common to both signals.
# Blind speed
Blind speeds in MTI (Moving Target Indicator) radar refer to the velocities of moving objects that are not detectable by the radar system.
Blind speeds occur when the frequency of the radar signal is equal to the Doppler frequency of a moving object, resulting in the radar signal being cancelled out and no detection of the object.
# Concept of Staggered Pulse Repetition Frequency
By transmitting pulses at different PRFs, the radar system can distinguish between targets at different ranges and velocities.
The staggered PRF technique also reduces the probability of range ambiguities and blind speeds occurring, which can improve the accuracy and reliability of the radar system.
In addition to mitigating range ambiguities and blind speeds, staggered PRF can also be used to improve the signal to noise ratio of the radar system by reducing the effects of clutter and interference.
